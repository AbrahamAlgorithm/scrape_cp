    "Machine Learning": "Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves analyzing and discovering patterns from data to make intelligent predictions or take action. Machine Learning has applications in various fields, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and data analysis.",
    "Network": "A Network is a collection of interconnected devices or systems that can communicate and share resources. Computer networks allow data and information to be transmitted between devices, facilitating communication and resource sharing. Networks can be classified based on their geographical scope, such as Local Area Networks (LANs) or Wide Area Networks (WANs), and can be wired or wireless.",
    "Operating System (OS)": "An Operating System is a software system that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides a platform for running applications. The operating system facilitates tasks such as process, memory, file, and device management. It is an intermediary between users and computer hardware, enabling efficient and secure system operation.",
    "Parallel Computing": "Parallel Computing is a computational model where multiple tasks or processes are executed simultaneously, taking advantage of multiple processors or cores. Parallel computing aims to solve complex problems faster by dividing them into smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently. It is used in scientific simulations, data analysis, and high-performance computing.",
    "Query": "In databases and information retrieval, a Query refers to a request for data or information from a database or search engine. Queries specify conditions, criteria, or parameters that define the desired data set or search results. Query languages, such as SQL (Structured Query Language), retrieve data from databases.",
    "Recursion": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function repeatedly calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems. Recursive functions have a base case that defines the terminating condition and recursive calls that solve the subproblems. Recursion is used in algorithms such as tree traversals, factorial calculation, and solving mathematical problems.",
